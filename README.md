# R2R-CSV-Reader

Road 2 Riches CSV Reader is an AJAX website used to read and go through a CSV file generated on spansh.co.uk/riches/.
It will display information about the route system after system, planet after planet and save your actual position in the browser cache.
As it's made with AJAX (JS + PHP), you'll need a working web server to use this project.

USAGE:
- Generate a route on spansh.co.uk/riches/.
- Download the CSV file for that route and rename it "list.csv".
- Place the "list.csv" file in the project folder.
- You're good to go Commander!
